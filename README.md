# Contributing

We're happy to accept pull requests, no matter how small.

Please make sure any changes you make meet these basic requirements:

 - Any code taken from other projects should be compatible with the MIT License
 - This is a new project, and as such, supporting Android versions prior to Api21 is very low priority.
 - However, we're happy to accept PRs to improve compatibility with older versions of Android, as long as it doesn't:
   - drastically increase the complexity of the code
   - OR cause problems for those on newer versions of Android.

**Legal Disclaimer for Contributions**

Nobody wants to read a long document filled with legal text, so we've summed up the important parts here.

If you contribute content that you've created/own to projects that are created/owned by profittools, such as code or 
documentation, then you might automatically grant us unrestricted usage of your content, regardless of the open source 
license that applies to our project.

If you don't want to grant us unlimited usage of your content, you should make sure to place your content
in a separate file, making sure that the license of your content is clearly displayed at the start of the file 
(e.g. code comments), or inside of it's containing folder (e.g. a file named LICENSE). 

You should let us know in your pull request or issue that you've included files which are licensed
separately, so that we can make sure there's no license conflicts that might stop us being able
to accept your contribution.

If you'd rather read the whole legal text, it should be included as `profittools_contribution_agreement.txt`.
